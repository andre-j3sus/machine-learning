Machine Learning:
 - method of data analysis
 - automates analytical model building
 - branch of artificial intelligence
 - identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention

Some algorithms:
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree
 - K-Nearest Neighbors
 - Support Vector Machine
 - Naive Bayes Algorithm
 - K-Means
 - Random Forest Algorithm


Model and Testing:
 - in machine learning, we create a model and try to predict the test data
 - training data -> used to fit the model
 - testing data  -> used to test the model


Linear Regression Algorithm:
 - model the relationship between two variables
 by fitting a linear equation to observed data
 - linear regression line equation: y = a + bx:
    - x: explanatory variable
    - y: dependent variable
    - a: slope of the line (how much the y value increases for each x value)
    - b: intercept (the value of y when x = 0)


K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
 - used for classifying data (in small data sets)
 - classify data into certain categories
 - works by looking at the K-closest points to the given data point
 (the one we want to classify) and picking the class that occurs the
 most to be the predicted value
 - computationally heavy: requires the entire data set to make a prediction
 - high memory usage: requires that the entire data set be loaded into memory to perform a prediction
 - K must be an odd number to prevent draws


Support Vector Machines (SVM):
 - powerful tool that is a good choice for classifying
 complicated data with a high degree of dimensions(features)
 - allow for us to classify data that does not have a linear correspondence
 - divides data into multiple classes using something called a hyper-plane:
     - hyper plane is a fancy word for something that is straight that can divide data points
     (in 2D is a line, in 3D is a plane, in any space higher than 3D it is simply called hyper-plane)
     - to create a hyper plane we need to pick two points known as the support vectors; their distance
     to the plane must be identical, and they need to be the closest points to the hyper-plane
     - we choose the hyper-plane with the greatest possible margin (distance between points and plane)
 - Kernels provide a way for us to create a hyper-plane for "unorganized" data,
 bring it up to a higher dimension (in this case from 2D->3D)
 - Popular kernels:
    - Linear
    - Polynomial
    - Circular
    - Hyperbolic Tangent (Sigmoid)
 - Types of margin:
     - Hard margin: no points may exist inside the margin
     - Soft margin: outliers may exist inside the margin
        - hyper-parameter is the amount of points allowed to exist inside the margin

AI (Artificial Intelligence) 
 -> ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) - AIs thath do one thing
 -> AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) - do anything or more than a human can do

What is AI?
 - Machine Learning
 - Data
 - What makes an AI company
 - What machine learning can and cannot do
 - Deep Learning (Neural Networks)


Machine Learning
 - Input to Output
 - More Data -> More Perfomance
 - Supervised learning
 - Running AI system
 - Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
 without being explicitly programmed
 
 
Data Science
 - Uses AI tools and interacts with it
 - Analyze data
 - Output is a set of insights that can help make descisions
 - Scienc of extracting knowledge and insights from data


Deep Learning
 - (Artificial) Neural Network
 - Input -> Neurons -> Output
 - Big mathematical equation
 - Machine learning tool


Data
 - Table of data (dataset)
 - Acquiring data:
	- Manual labeling
	- Observing behaviors
	- Download from websites / partnerships
 - Data problems
	- Incorect lables
	- Missing values
 - Multiple types of data
	- structured data -> datasets / tables
	- unstructured data -> text, audio, videos

AI Projects

Steps of a machine learning project:
 1. Collect date
 2. Train Model (iterate many times until good enough)
 3. Deploy model (get data back, maintain and update model)

Workflow of a data science project:
 1. Collect data
 2. Analyze data (iterate many times to get good insights)
 3. Suggest hypotheses/actions (deploy changes; re-analyzse new data)
